 3d shooter
Discord
After working mostly on libraries this year (such as lunex), this showcase shows off the author's initial work on a 3d shooter. There's a first person controller and an extended player model. One aspect of this showcase that I love a lot is the ability to use your existing Minecraft skin as a texture.

There were a couple of interesting updates during the week, including weapon sway and a movement state machine
